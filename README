This script can be very useful to produce a readable book version of your usr_*.txt files.
It generates on its standard output a latex file from all the usr_*.txt.

I know, it's far from perfect but it produced a quite good latex file for me.
Email me if you want to get latex, dvi or pdf generated output.
